  #   if !(user = User.find_by_id(params[:id])) # platform had method find which throws up an exception if it does not exist. find_by_id works better here because it does not throw exception and just returns nil if id doesn't exist
  #     redirect_to "/sessions/new" # better to have above conditional in case someone tried a path with non-existant user id. Strange that long numbers and only letters redirect and show correct URL with user's id. However, correnct id followed by letters does not change URL back to just id
  #   elsif user != current_user
  #     redirect_to "/users/#{current_user.id}"
